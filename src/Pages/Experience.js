          <p className="company">Mamo Technolabs LLP</p>
          <p className="duration">December 2024 â€“ March 2025</p>
          <p className="description">
            Completed a 3-month internship as a Web Development Intern, where I worked on building a full-stack job portal using modern web technologies like React.js, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, and Clerk authentication.
            Gained practical experience in developing user authentication, job application workflows, recruiter-student dashboards, and a tab-restricted MCQ test system.  
            Also integrated APIs, handled UI responsiveness, and used tools like Postman, Git, and Sentry for debugging and testing.
